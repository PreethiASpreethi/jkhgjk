Input:
code = """ a = 6+5
           print(a)"""
Output:
11
Explanation:
Mind it that "code" is a variable and
not python code. It contains another code, 
which we need to execute.

Input:
code = """ def factorial(num):
               for i in range(1,num+1):
                   fact = fact*i
               return fact
           print(factorial(5))"""
